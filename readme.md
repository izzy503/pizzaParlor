// Example modification in the Pizza constructor
function Pizza(toppings, size) {
  // Add or modify the toppings and size options here
  this.toppings = toppings;
  this.size = size;
}

// Example modification in the calculateCost prototype method
Pizza.prototype.calculateCost = function() {
  // Modify the formula for calculating the cost here
  // based on the toppings and size selected
  let cost = 0;

  // Your custom calculation logic goes here

  return cost;
};
Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS files to match your preferred styling and design.
