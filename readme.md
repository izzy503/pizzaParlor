# Customization

You can customize the toppings, sizes, and cost calculation by modifying the JavaScript code in the javascript.js file. Update the topping options, size options, and the formula for calculating the cost in the Pizza constructor and calculateCost prototype method.
// Example modification in the Pizza constructor
function Pizza(toppings, size) {
  // Add or modify the toppings and size options here
  this.toppings = toppings;
  this.size = size;
}

// Example modification in the calculateCost prototype method
Pizza.prototype.calculateCost = function() {
  // Modify the formula for calculating the cost here
  // based on the toppings and size selected
  let cost = 0;

  // Your custom calculation logic goes here

  return cost;
};
Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS files to match your preferred styling and design.
